# hIPPYlib 2.3.0

This image provides a full-featured and optimized build of hIPPYlib 2.3.0 and FEniCS 2017.2.

This image contains the implementation of the model problems discussed in

Umberto Villa, Noemi Petra, and Omar Ghattas. 2019.
hIPPYlib: An Extensible Software Framework for Large-Scale Inverse Problems Governed by PDEs: Part I: Deterministic Inversion and Linearized Bayesian Inference.
submitted ACM Trans. Math. Softw. (September 2019), 33 pages.

Numerical results for the ``Coefficient field inversion in a Poisson PDE problem'' (Section 5.1) can be reproduced with the command

    cd applications/poisson/
    python model_subsurf.py

Numerical results for the ``Inversion for the initial condition in an advection-diffusion PDE'' (Section 5.2) can be reproduced with the command

   cd applications/ad_diff
   python model_ad_diff.py

Additional tutorials are located in the `tutorial` folder in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
To start a Jupyter notebook server use the command

     jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0
